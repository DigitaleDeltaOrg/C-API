### Handling Paging

The DD-API and DD-ECO-API both require paging. Z-INFO does not support paging.

Paging is beneficial for the data source, but not so much for the consumer and convenience is key in this project.

The Plug-in therefore is responsible for handling paging, if the data source requires it.
