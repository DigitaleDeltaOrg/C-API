# Quantity

A physical quantity is a quantifiable physical property of a phenomenon, a physical body or matter. 
This means that the property can be measured directly, or can be expressed in other physical quantities.
Some examples of common physical quantities are length, distance, mass and duration.

Quantities can be combined into new quantities. For example, the speed is defined as the distance travelled divided by the time course. This quantity is formed by the quantities length and time.
These derived or combined quantities are officially referred to as derived quantities. (Wikipedia)

Quantities in water management include:
- the quantity of substance (mol)
- the temperature (T or K)
- the depth (meters)
- the mass (kilograms)
- the angle (radial)
- radioactivity (becquerel)
- the time (second)

Derived quantities are for example:
- the area (square meters)
- the content (cubic meters)
- the concentration (mol per cubic meter) [Also called kilograms per cubic meter]
- the speed (meters per second)
