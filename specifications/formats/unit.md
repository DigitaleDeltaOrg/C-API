# Unit

A unit is a measure in which physical quantities can be expressed numerically. 
The number of units is called the numeric value; this is itself a dimensionless number. 
The value of the quantity can be considered as the product of the numerical value and the unit. 
The dimension of the quantity is the same as that of the unit.

For example, the distance from Earth to the moon averages 384440 kilometers, either 0.000 000 040 64 light-years, or 1 261 300 000 feet. 
Kilometer, light-year and foot are units of length. The ground units are laid down in the Système International (SI). 
These derived or combined units are officially referred to as derived units, which are represented for convenience by a single symbol. (Wikipedia).
