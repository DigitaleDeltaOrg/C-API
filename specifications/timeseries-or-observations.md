# Timeseries or observations

The data stored in time series are relatively easy: only the measurement time and the measured value differ within a timeseries.

Given the fixed time intervals between measurements, this makes it a compact format.

However, in ecological measurements more data needs to be retained.

Examples: apparatus used for sampling, analysing or measuring the data.

But also information such as life stage, shape, etc. These can not be expressed in timeseries.

Furthermore: observation-style measurements do not have a fixed time interval between measurements and not nearly in the frequency of automated measurements.

Using timeseries as a format would therefore result in loss of data.


The responses are therefore given in observations, not timeseries. When needed, observations can be represented in timeseries, however.
