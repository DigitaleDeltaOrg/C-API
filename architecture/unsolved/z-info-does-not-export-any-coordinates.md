# Unsolved: [Z-INFO](https://www.hetwaterschapshuis.nl/z-info) does not expose any coordinates

As it stands, [Z-INFO](https://www.hetwaterschapshuis.nl/z-info) (by convention, not by design) does not expose any coordinates.
This limits situations such as geographical map selections.
Systems to lookup coordinates based on names, seem to be organisation-specific, making it difficult to define a generic mechanism.

The [DAMO](https://damo.hetwaterschapshuis.nl) system may solve this issue, but it is unknown if all [Z-INFO](https://www.hetwaterschapshuis.nl/z-info) measurement objects are in there.
