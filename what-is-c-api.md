# What is C-API

The C-API attempts to conveniently simplify the gathering process. It does that by providing a single, but flexible query format and export format.

It has a plug-in architecture that allows additional data-sources to be added. The plug-ins take care of querying the data source using a standardised query format and returning the data in the standardised export format.

The C-API in this form is classified as a pilot project as there are some [unknowns](/architecture/architecture.md#topics-left-undefined). De code produced to visualize this project has the status of Proof of Concept.
