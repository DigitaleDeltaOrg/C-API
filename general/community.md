# Community

Our hope is to make this project community-driven and become an ecosystem. 
The community (parties of interest, ranging from contributors to code and specs, and users of the implementations) 
can offer feedback, contribute to code and specifications, show-case their solutions, etc.

[Informatiehuis Water](htts://ihw.nl) will govern this specification, meaning they will offer insight on how the contributions will conform to the intended usage.
