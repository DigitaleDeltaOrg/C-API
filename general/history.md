# History

The C-API is the brain child of Johannes Meerding of [Hoogheemraadschap van Delfland](https://www.hhdelfland.nl) (HvD), to attempt to combine measurements from different sources.

Faced by the fact that different systems had different interfaces, different query languages and different formats, and some systems did not even provide a method to export data for data analysis, he started this project.

The initial version was designed and developed by [EcoSys](https://www.ecosys.nl) on request of [HvD](https://www.hhdelfland.nl). [HvD](https://www.hhdelfland.nl) graciously donated the project to Open Source. [Informatiehuis Water](https://www.ihw.nl) is governing this specification as a member of the [Digital Delta family of standards](https://digitaledeltaorg.github.io).
